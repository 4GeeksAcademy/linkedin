# Optimize your LinkedIn profile

Your LinkedIn profile represents a more complete (and interactive) resume. 
You can include it as a link in an email or your cover letter when you apply for jobs.

LinkedIn is also the most important work-related social media platform out there so having a visible profile can help you connect with the right people and help you land a job.

LinkedIn, like Google, works based on keywords! So if a company is looking for IT Talent, the first thing that they will have in mind to search for are the technologies. So itâ€™s important to optimize it based on those keywords, the more times these keywords appear on your profile, the better positioned will be.
